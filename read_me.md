the right place. And then it will send you daily
lesson plans until you finish a task, thing, or idea. 

Then it tracks your progress and gives you the next lesson to work on.
You pick what you want to learn. Pause it if you
don't like something (you only get 3 skips for the
module).

creating new habits.**
