Dont worry you will be copy pasting two lines in
the right place. And then it will send you daily
lesson plans until you finish a thing. Then it
tracks your progress and gives you the next lesson.
You pick what you want to learn. Pause it if you
dont like something (but you only get 3 skips for the
